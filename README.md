# Space-Travellers

A React-Redux app that fetches information on Rockets from this API `https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/rockets` 

![Rockets listing](/src/assets/Rockets.png?raw=true "Rockets listing")

... and information on Rockets from this API `https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/missions`

![Missions listing](/src/assets/Missions.png?raw=true "Missions listing")

The user can then reserve a rocket

![Rocket selected](/src/assets/Rocket-selected.png?raw=true "Rocket selected")

... or become an active member of a mission.

![Mission selected](/src/assets/Mission-selected.png?raw=true "Mission selected")

The My Profile page will display the rockets that the user has reserved and the missions that he/she has become an active member of.
